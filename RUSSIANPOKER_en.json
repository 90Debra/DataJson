  "HELP_MODAL_CONTENT": "The game is played using one 52-card deck. The game uses standard poker rules for ranking and comparing hands.\nThe player places his mandatory Ante wager, plus an optional Bonus bet.\nThe player and the dealer are dealt five cards, with the dealer’s last (5th) card turned face up.\nThe player must make a decision to either Fold, Bet, Buy, or Draw:\n * <b>Fold:</b> The player’s five cards are discarded. The dealer will collect the losing Ante.\n * <b>Bet:</b> The player places a wager of 2x the Ante in the BET box.\n * <b>Buy:</b> The player places 1x Ante to buy a 6th Card.\n * <b>Draw:</b> The player places 1x Ante to exchange 1-5 cards.\nIf the player invoked either the Buy or the Exchange option, then the Fold or Bet decision will be made based on the new hand.\nIf the player has a hand of Three of a Kind or better, an <b>Insurance Bet</b> amounting to at least the player’s Ante bet and no more than half of the payout in paytable for the player’s Raise bet can be placed.\nIn case the player has two combinations at the same time the insurance will be bought for both combinations. For that the first combination needs to be at least a Three of a Kind or higher.\nThe dealer’s cards are then opened and the poker value of the hand declared.\nIf the dealer qualifies with a hand of Ace-King or higher, the player’s hand will be settled as follows:\n * <b>Player wins:</b> Ante pushes and Bet is paid according to paytable.\n * <b>Tie:</b> both Ante and Bet push.\n * <b>Dealer wins:</b> all wagers will lose, except possibly the Bonus bet which is settled separately.\nIf the player’s winning hand also contains a <b>second poker combination</b>, then the player will be paid for both combinations, even if the second combination doesn’t beat the dealer’s hand. For the second combination to qualify, it must contain at least one card which wasn’t included in the first winning combination. Should there be more than one way to make a second combination the highest paying combination will be used.\nThe Insurance Bet will be settled as follows:\n * If the dealer’s hand is lower than Ace-King the Insurance Bet pays 1:1.\n * If the dealer’s hand is equal to or better than the player’s hand, the Insurance Bet is returned to the player.\n * If the dealer’s hand is Ace-King or better, but worse than the player’s hand, the Insurance Bet is lost.\nIf the dealer doesn’t qualify then the player has an option to <b>buy a card for the dealer</b> at the cost equal to the Ante bet.\n * If the player opts against this option Bet is returned and Ante pays 1:1. Any amount paid to buy a 6th card or pay to Exchange cards is lost.\n * If the player exercises the option to buy a card for the dealer, the highest card in dealer’s hand will be replaced with the new card. If the new card is of the same rank as the card it was replacing then the card will be drawn again until the rank is different.\n * If, as a result of the replacement, the dealer qualifies and the player’s hand is still higher than the dealer’s hand the players Ante pushes and players Bet is paid according to the paytable.\n * If, following the replacement of the card, the dealer’s hand is higher than the player’s hand, the player loses all wagers, except possibly the Bonus bet which is settled separately.\nThe Bonus bet will pay based on the player’s initial cards only and according to the bonus paytable.",
  "HELP_MODAL_RTP": "The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) in Russian Poker for different bet types when played with optimal strategy:\n * Ante 99.54%\n * Bonus 81.66% \nThis is a theoretical average based on a large number of games and not a guarantee for a single session.",
